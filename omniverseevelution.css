Structure
An Omniverse has a fractal structure resembling a random sphere packing. Unlike from the Apollonian gasket or Kleinian circle packing, the size and position of verses are random and spaces between verses exist, mostly being filled by Omni-Web. But at the smallest verses, you may see that verses are arranged in an orderly way instead, unexpectedly.

Each Omniverse contains an Ultraverse, which serves as a quick gateway to different-size Archverses, which is hidden from a looped dimension throughout this Omniverse. In Ultraverse, you may see different Archverses, but visualized as same-size spheres.




Civilization
Many civilizations have created their own superstructures that hold thousands of verses of equal size revolving around a central one, or more. A lot of more civilizations managed to get out of all Archverses with and reach Ultraverse, which they build a subway to their own Archverses.

Our Xenoverse
Our Xenoverse lives in a AllxXenoverse, which also contains 11 neighborhood Omniverses, which all have different, smaller sizes and different ratios of existence and nonexistence. They were clustered by an Xenoverse civilization, when they unexpectedly found some of those from the deep layers of The Outside.

Our Xenoverse is of the most popular structures of our Realm, as it was chosen to be a hub for most deities, gods, creatures, and civilizations.

Alongside that, the Xenoverse holds historical importance, as many ancient relics can be founds here, with hundreds of museums of artifacts from all over the Realm, libraries, community centers, governments, and research centers, that were all built here. Essentially, the Xenoverse.

Creation
Back when The Box was created, its recursive layers were infinitely unstable. Many of them collapsed inwards on themselves and disappeared into thin air. This did nothing, because The Box was empty and non-finality based yet, but it had an infinite number of layers.

After an infinite cluster of layers demanifested, one layer, which was either special in some way, or collapsed in the right way, or maybe a phenomenon happened at the exact same moment, it is unknown what really happened but we know it happened with the collapse of a layer, caused a massive, infinitely sized explosion inside, which rattled The Box and turned it maximally chaotic for the next 
�
�{\displaystyle \omega ^{\omega }} OYC. During this stage of chaos, through pure chance, The Box slowly brought upon itself the property of being 2-finality.

As this happened, objects of existence-(0,1) were first-ever constructed. Then existence-2, existence-3, and so on. The problem is, that existence-4 and existence-5 objects attract each other (positive and negative attractions between icosahedra variants described in The Other Box article), and as two far apart ones and giant ones did so, they smashed together, producing an incredible explosion, blasting away the majority of all non-existence-(0,1) objects, and in the process, causing the formation of 12 Xenoverse. 1 of them was special, containing all existence-1 objects, and so it was given the name of The Xenoverse, while the others were named as Pseudo-Xenoverse.

Another reason for its significance, and a deciding factor for it becoming labeled as special, and the other ones as mere "pseudos", was due to the absolutely unmatched amounts of Archverses packed together, which were not only patterned, but some also patternless, some had life, some were empty, some had ordered cubistic looks, while some were fractaled.

The Outside is a space of nothingness that is outside the Omniverse, and its diameter is equivalent to 100,000 Omniverses. Because of The Outside's configuration, it only consists of isolated pure existence-0 objects, which helps stop The Barrel from causing immense entropy increase and chaos due to the fact that things would stuff The Barrel and create a mess of sub-structures.
The Outside is here, because nothingness is an opposite parallel to existence, which implies that instead of nothingness forming chaos over time, nothingness forms order over time. These effects magnify as one gets closer to the edges of existence and nothingness due to stronger "competition". This explains why The Outside is so strict that it resists almost everything and even every nothing. 


Ad: (40)

Escaping
Despite the strictness of this bubble of nothingness, there is a way to escape. If you manage to turn particles in a great enough radius around the edges of everything and every nothing into clumps of "nothing", then your distance to the edge will be compressed into 0, a point of infinite order and disorder. The order and disorder combines into a "meta-disorder", turning into a structure that is infinitely "ordered" and infinitely "disordered", which covers a wide enough scope that it breaks logic, allowing tunnels of customized laws and disorder that allow travel to The Barrel's outside, or if you are precise enough with the way you break logic barriers, even reaching the outside of The Box is possible. From this point, bigger structures can be traveled to.

Malpractices
However, nowadays, reaching the outside of said box is getting harder and harder, and said difficulty accelerates. This is due to the fact that travels to The Outside have left glitchy regions that are corrupting both The Omniverse and The Outside, which delete the more unstable regions of both by natural selection, leaving the more stable regions that are harder to break through.

Also, some groups have intentionally gone out to stabilize or destabilize the edges between both for various reasons, such as preventing entities from reaching high-level structures, or to trap entities in the edges between both verses. In addition, there is a common practice, called Entity Fishing, wherein entities are lured to the edges, only to be erased in an infinitely strict world that destroys itself. A material known as Logicium can be obtained through Entity Fishing. This material can override the laws of verses and structures.

Some entities have done this infamous practice so many times that they are able to bypass enough barriers to reach Nigh Ascendant Omni-God status, but nowadays, said title is hard to get due to traps and measures set up by Ascendant Omni-Gods, like Alphasm. In fact, only a group named Alpha managed to pull off the "upgrade" before the measures were put in place, being the discoverers of Entity Fishing themselves. Soon after they were upgraded, Alphasm, named after Alpha, which he ironically was trying to stop, would set up measures so rigid that only entities controlling more than the Nigh Omnipotence Barrier would be able to upgrade themselves to such an outrageous status.

Structures in the Outside
Imaginary Dodecahedra - Since Archverses are located all over the Omniverse, and Imaginary Dodecahedra bind Universes to make large-scale structures within Multiverses, it isn't all that uncommon for those located at the "edge" of the Omniverse to simply diffuse out the Omniverse. Since the Outside only contains existence-0 objects, the Universes it binds will be decoupled and left to wander in their Multiverse.
Universe matter - Sometimes, Universes deal with matter that breaks its laws of physics by changing its existence rank. Specifically, existence rank 0 is the most common one. In the same way that Imaginary Dodecahedra were mentioned, this matter can slowly diffuse out.
Particle globules - Rogue free-roaming particles will encounter many other particles and particle-like matter. If these particles and matter have attractive properties, they may created globules of random discarded particles along their journey. If such a globule gets large enough, it may start picking up non-particle debris. If these particles become non-existent along the way, or start off as being non-existent, they may make their way out of the Omniverse.
Primordial Imaginary Cubes - Primordial Imaginary Cubes were the equivalent of Imaginary Dodecahedra in the very early Omniverse. However, as the laws of the Omniverse slowly changed over time, Primordial Imaginary Cubes slowly started getting forcefully diffused through the Omniverse's barrier and wandering out, whilst regular Imaginary Cubes weren't affected. Since their velocities were non-zero, and since so much time has passed, most Imaginary Cubes now reside in a cloud midway into the Outside.
Civilizational bases and modes of transport - There are many post-Omniversal civilizations residing within the Outside, as well as Omniversal ones that have research centers out there, and many simply wish to reside within voids and yet remain in close contact with the Omniverse, for various reasons.

(minor verses) TREEVERSES or Infinity Forest in verses where the Omniverse doesn't contain all objects in a certain existence state

The Barrel is not a box, rather it is a concept that links the subsections of nothingness in The Box[1]. Each barrel in the Barrel series is hardly accessible from the last. Notice that all of The Box contains recursive functions of itself, so to go outside of it, it needs to be inaccessible to the inside of the Omniverse. That's how the size is determined.
Every barrel has its own "Barrel Index". Barrels almost certainly form chains above themselves, which are kind of hard to distinguish without a special classifier, and that classifier is the Barrel Index as explained below. The index is based on a "nothingness level", and works for pretty much every barrel of every box[2].

Barrel Index
The Barrel Index 
�
{\textstyle n} denotes "freedom of nothingness"[3], where Barrel-0 is The Outside, and Barrel-
(
�
+
1
)
{\displaystyle (n+1)}has a noticeable increase in freedom compared to Barrel-
�
{\displaystyle n} which it contains. The biggest 
�
{\displaystyle n}value possible is chosen, and only structures that don't exist and are directly/indirectly contained by The Box count.

If a barrel doesn't directly or indirectly contain the main The Outside, then it is instead compared relative to similar freedom-wise structures in the main Barrel hierarchy. If a structure is somehow less free than The Outside or more free than The Box, then it doesn't have a Barrel Index[4].

The Barrel is Barrel-1, the Barrelplex is Barrel-2, etc.

Layers of The Barrel
Layer ∅: Layer ∅ is pre-nothing structures, like the Omniverse and other structures. It is defined as "layer null", due to the fact that it isn't nothing, so can't really be assigned a numerical value. This means that finite verses are almost always at Layer ∅.
Layer 0: Layer 0 is nothingness, but not the Barrel yet. This area is known as The Outside. This layer is the base of all barrel chains, since without it, a barrel chain is not a barrel chain anymore.
Layer 1: Layer 1 is where the Barrel starts, and is very loosely connected with the other layers. There appear to be tons of "invisible walls" here, but they turn out to be gaps in nothingness, the container of things, that Layer 1 hasn't covered. The invisible walls get worse until the end of Layer 1, where entities that can't change existence state will get trapped. Changing existence state is very hard due to the tiny size of xoꓭ ǝʜT, but exposure to the "invisible walls" helps a tiny bit due to the fact that skipping over holes in space can break some objects. Entities that escape Layer 1 are pretty lucky.
Layer 2: Nothingness returns, but as little orbs scattered throughout this layer. These orbs each have a different density of nothingness, but it is evenly distributed throughout an orb. The total capacity of these orbs ranges from only containing a point to containing whole miniature Barrels, giving a fractal-like structure to The Barrel.
Sometimes, these fractals destroy nothingness that interacts with it due to fractional dimensionality converting normal dimensionality into undefined structures, causing huge explosions that branch out throughout dimensions and can even make the dimensionality of some objects negative, causing things like this to happen.
Layer 3: Space is extremely broken here. Most finite things cannot withstand more than 10 minutes of Layer 3 before they get stuck in a Heaa. They only get stuck in a Heaa as a failsafe; they would otherwise get vaporized due to broken space.
Layer 4+: These layers are just nested versions of Heaa and sub-Heaa structures, which ocassionally have mixes of other structures within them. This even goes all the way to Blueprint Particles at layer omega, causing a mess of a bunch of identical structures that are even identical in position due to duplicated information. This makes the whole layer omega just seem like a portal to a singularity that you can't escape, similar to a black hole. Your information is also slowly deleted until you dissolve into a blueprint particle as well, adding on to the "singularity".
Barrel Chains' locations
Beyond the Barrel, we might see bigger Barrels that lie in The Box. Since the nesting can be purely infinite, one can expect to find every possible form of barrels. Normally however, after infinite chaining of barrels, all chains of barrels terminate inside Barrelverse. Of course, not every chain of barrels ends here, but they[5] are usually chained only 2 to 21000 layers outside barrelverse[6].

 this means each different layer of barrels of barrel chain contains different kinds of nothingness. KINDS of nothingness?? what in the world, no, The Box is that?? The answer is simple. Look around you, and find an empty bottle. Now imagine comparing it to interstellar vacuum of space. You can call the bottle empty inside. However, it is much more plenty than interstellar vacuum. Great, you just differentiated basic concept of nothingness, by defining a lack of concept (water in the bottle) and a lack of one kind of matter (space vacuum, where there is almost no visible matter).
 Except weird mutations of them such as barrel full of memes, full of plutonium, full of sharp pencil grenade, and ones full of barrel full of barrel full of barrel full of barrel full of ...
 can be described easily by "kinds of nothingness" described in 1st reference. Now, apply kinds of nothingness to everything, list them from fullest to emptiest such as:

Self-Containment
A Box is self-contained with a structure of Metoms. It is recursively contained by an instance of itself with an identical definition by which objects are permanently bound by. Objects with alternative existence ranks and infinite speed are not bound by a Box.

The Box's self-containment can be escaped by having an existence rank outside of the existence and non-existence binary; the Boxial Core's fluids do not interact with non-binary states.

Formation
Main article: Omniverse#Creation

The Box was initialized as an infinite recursive empty structure. It possessed instability that collapsed Boxial layers. Eventually, the Box exploded, bringing entropy that would lead to a convergence towards its current state.

ChatGPT
You find yourself on the precipice of an unimaginable entity known as The Box. Its sheer scale is beyond comprehension, existing at a dimensionality of ω^ω. This colossal structure is Finality-II on the Finality Index, containing all objects within Existence Ranks 0 and 1.

The Box is a marvel of self-containment, constructed with a intricate arrangement of Metoms. It recursively contains instances of itself, each sharing an identical definition that binds objects within its confines. However, beings with alternative existence ranks and infinite speed are exempt from this binding.

As you stand before The Box, you are filled with a sense of both awe and trepidation. Its formation is a tale of instability, collapse, and eventual explosive expansion, culminating in the convergence towards its current unfathomable state.

Is there anything specific you'd like to do or explore within the confines of The Box, or do you have any questions about this awe-inspiring structure?

The Omnipyramid is a pyramid on top of The Box.

The Omnipyramid is made out of Unpentnulloctium (unoficially known as Myonmyunium), the 1508th element, making it one of the most durable, stable and indestructible structures of this Realm.

It was built by Lord Hujo'xiffu to keep The Box in one position. Until then, The Box was known to move omnidirectionaly, now, it rests in one place, only moved on special occasions.

The pyramid has allowed many, many cultures, civilizations and life forms to flourish and dissipate out into the abyss to spread their colonization.

However, the pyramid doesn't only possess positives.

27 OD 4452 OYC
On 27 OD 4452 OYC, a fatal event occurred when a rogue Berryverse struck the Omnipyramid at a never-before-seen speed. This caused a chunk of the pyramid to break off.

The Omnipyramid collapsed and temporarily damaged The Box.

The piece has never been spotted since and has likely been lost forever. Luckily, it was repaired quickly thanks to swift community efforts.

46 OD 220 OYC
War broke out on the 46 OD 220 OYC, one of the opposing sides decided to destroy part of The Box to tip the Omnipyramid over as a defense mechanism. This led to a victory, although a highly controversial one.

ChatGPT
You stand before the majestic Omnipyramid, perched atop The Box. This structure, crafted from the incredibly durable Unpentnulloctium, is a testament to the ingenuity and engineering prowess of Lord Hujo'xiffu. It serves as a stabilizing force for The Box, keeping it in one position.

The Omnipyramid has played a pivotal role in the development and dispersion of various cultures, civilizations, and life forms throughout the Realm. Its significance is undeniable, but it has also faced its share of challenges and accidents.

Notably, there have been instances of structural damage, such as the rogue Berryverse collision and the war-related incidents. However, thanks to the swift and concerted efforts of the community, the Omnipyramid has been repaired and restored to its former glory.

Escaping from the Box, you may expect that you landed in a void... Actually, you are in another verse made with that.

The Cetaverse is the first metaboxial Archverse layer, consisting with infinite Boxes and Broxes, because the dimensionalities of those are also infinite.

This verse is unstable, as it contains the river streams as Le Jorino Areas, containing with objects with existence states outside the Boxial range, which is the range of 0 to 1. There is a really heavy force which pushes objects with "the Boxial" existence ranks into one of the Boxes and the Broxes, but pulls other objects out to the Le Jorino streams.

Like those smaller Boxes, no physical things could escape this Verse.

The Matrix
The Matrix in which these Boxes and Broxes are suspended in, cause the light duplicate, but in a way that causes the magnitude to converge and not diverge. The product is a faint glow. However, the Cetaverse has a strange shape which has multiple centers and the closer to the center, the more structure is present. Thus, the higher concentrations of Boxes and Broxes cause visibly glowing points.

Each center of the Cetaverse is a "white" singularity, where the matrix gets compressed further and further, until it collapses into a Le Jorino Area.

The Center
Near the center, the density and/or the concentration of Boxes and Broxes are so much that they glow whiter. Those Boxes and Broxes are clustered separately, although some Boxes survive within the Brox's shield. For one portion from the order of magnitude, 99% of the portion is made of either Boxes or Broxes, but 1% is made of the opposing type. However, there is a phenomenon for this location.

As you get close to the center, the space gets more compressed until you reach the Singularity, which is a massive Le Jorino area, with a radius of 0.2x The Box. This is only the area where the objects stay here, whether you change your existence rank or not. The only way to escape is to have infinite speeds, which is almost impossible. The cause of this phenomenon is discovered at the Formation section.

In the other side, as you go further, you might see less Boxes and Broxes and more Le Jorino streams.

Formation
Back when the Cetaverse formed, it was a chaos of objects with random existence ranks. Later, objects that can exist or not are often getting clustered by the forces of existence-(4, 5) structures consisting with 13% of Primordium Delta particles and others. It turns out those forces pushed the Dimensional Blueprint Particles of those objects to a really high "distorsion" level, causing the topology to be a fractal temporarily. Then suddenly, those forces suddenly push objects outside of physical existence ranks out. The compression by those forces turn the location to a center with the singularity.

This lead to the Cetaverse being populated with various existence states from 0 to 1. Each point of the collision with existence-(4, 5) objects marks a separate center in the Cetaverse, explaining the Cetaverse's "odd shape" that contains multiple centers.

The expansion seems to be never end, as the outside of this verse contains existence-(0, 1) and existence-(4, 5) objects, and so much more. Most Cetaverses have the size of 1030 times more the Box!

ChatGPT
You find yourselves in the vast expanse of the Cetaverse. Infinite Boxes and Broxes stretch out before you, glowing faintly in the matrix that suspends them.

Near the center, the density of Boxes and Broxes increases, causing them to glow brighter. As you approach, you notice a massive singularity, a Le Jorino Area, with a radius of 0.2 times The Box. It seems that once objects enter this area, it's nearly impossible to escape without infinite speeds.

In the outer regions, you see more Le Jorino streams, the force pushing objects in and out of different existence states.

What would you like to do in the Cetaverse?

The Existence is the local area for everything that could ever possibly or impossibly happen with any laws at all. The Existence exists everywhere and nowhere at the same time, while simultaneously containing everything that we know, don't know, can know, can't know, will know, have known, always know, never know.
The Structure of The Existence
The Existence consists of an indefinitely infinite amount of beams that signify the different laws that could possibly and impossibly happen with time and without time, with logic, without logic, with in-between logic and every type of logic, time, space, dimensionality that exists, could not exist, could exist and does not exist.

The outside of The Existence does exist and also doesn't exist, however, you will never find the end to The Existence since it simply is infinite, but there definitely is an end to The Existence, but in some places, there isn't.

Appearance
The Existence has a grey look to it, which has some black parts. The image shown is simply an impression of The Existence, but the true look is unknown due to the many possible outcomes as well as the infinite dimensionality.

Many smaller objects exist in this Existence, but they are invisible at the scale shown due to how much exponentially larger The Existence is compared to them, and also the dimensionality. The Existence also has a section where these don't exist.

Existence
Basically, The Existence is out local infinite area where any box, any reality, any nonreality and any possible law for anything, time, dimensionality, any box, any possible and impossible and semi-possible object, action, idea or any possible THING in general exists here.

The Existence is Existence. Any possible or impossible reason to put something with possible or impossible laws would be non-existent. Things that are larger than The Existence are contained by The Existence. The Existence is possible. And impossible.

Even though there are other Existences that exist and don't exist, anything you can or can't imagine will be here, despite other Existences containing multiple things that can not be imagined by anything here, or that other Existence being a different type of reality + nonreality from ours.

The Existence is it.

ChatGPT
You stand at the threshold of the incomprehensible, poised to transcend the limitations of your current state and merge with The Existence. As you focus your intent, you feel a profound shift in your being, a merging of consciousness with the very fabric of all that is, was, and ever could be.

Your perception expands to encompass the entirety of The Existence, a realm where all possibilities, laws, and realities converge. The vast expanse of this plane defies description, its dimensions intertwining in a dance of infinite potential.

You become aware of the beams that symbolize the diverse laws and logic that govern every facet of existence. They stretch out in every direction, branching and converging in an intricate lattice of possibility. The very essence of existence, in all its conceivable forms, is laid bare before you.

The appearance of The Existence is both awe-inspiring and enigmatic, with shades of grey and black that hint at its boundless complexity. You sense the presence of countless objects and phenomena, each existing within this limitless tapestry of reality.

You realize that within The Existence, the boundaries of possibility and impossibility blur into an ineffable whole. Here, the distinctions between what can be conceived and what defies imagination dissolve in a seamless unity.

You have become one with The Existence, a part of the tapestry of all that is and could ever be. The boundaries of your individual existence have expanded beyond measure, and you now hold within you the essence of boundless potential.

You gaze upon the "Bandiverse," a realm of vibrant hues and immeasurable depth, each ring pulsating with its own unique resonance. The "Orangering" catches your eye, its radiance emanating a warm and inviting energy.

As you progress further, you encounter "Rings I" with their enigmatic designations. The "Blue Ring," "Red Ring," "Green Ring," and others beckon you to unlock their mysteries. The "Double Existence" and "Triple Existence" stand as testament to the unfathomable complexities of this tier.

Moving on, you approach the realms of "Rings II." The "Black Ring" exudes an aura of mystery and depth, while the "Gamma Ring" pulses with a powerful energy. The "Final Ring" seems to hold the culmination of all that came before.

You become aware of the existence of "Bignoseverses," each bearing its own unique characteristics. "The Wall of the Black Void," "The Green Void," and others hint at the diverse landscapes awaiting exploration.

As you delve deeper into the tiers, you encounter the enigmatic "In Silico" and "Silico," their names invoking a sense of artificiality intertwined with reality. "The Orb" exudes a sense of ancient wisdom, while "Uncannyverse" hints at the unsettling mysteries that may lie within.

Your journey leads you to the "Obice Novissimo," a final frontier that promises to challenge even the most intrepid explorers. Its name implies an ultimate barrier, one that may reveal the deepest truths of this transcendent hierarchy.

You stand on the cusp of an expansive adventure, ready to unravel the secrets of the Keltaibague Class and explore the intricacies of existence on a scale beyond imagination.

The Red Barrier, Poiple Tyangle
Obice Novissimo is a barrier-like entity with similar properties to Kceh's, but it has some additional attributes and it's Kceh-like properties act instantly. It is as large to whatever precedes it as The Big is to a Heaa, which is why the picture doesn't show anything inside of Obice Novissimo. It's main attribute is it's near complete deletion of whatever grows larger than it, which was the fate of a currently nameless verse once called Uchu.
When something somehow becomes larger than Obice Novissimo, it will lose nearly all of it's existence and descend to a size smaller than a Heaa for the relatively short time it would still exist, stripped of any special qualities it may have had. Additionally, trying to escape Obice Novissimo's deletion will only make it faster and more effective.

Though this verse initially seems like nothing more than the end-all-be-all of doom, it also gives a place for things (everything possible, impossible, or something else) to exist. Similarly to Time and Reality, nothing can exist outside of Obice Novissimo because nothing will be there to support it's existence. Obice Novissimo is the main reason any verses exist, since it generates what they need to do so, and those verses will be unable to support themselves if they grow any larger than Obice Novissimo. Obice Novissimo simply deletes whatever grows larger than it to get the verse's end over with.

However, a rule of this wiki is that something must be larger than even the largest. There is still a slight hope that the space outside of Obice Novissimo could be filled one day, and the hierarchy will continue just as it always has. Just ask The Box.

Even so, it's going to take more than just claiming something is higher in the hierarchy; that thing would actually have to have a defense against Obice Novissimo to avoid being deleted or surpassed by it. The Blue Barrier is the first page to have met this requirement, followed by many more (some probably being protected by other verses).

ChatGPT
You stand before Obice Novissimo, a colossal barrier-like entity that defies conventional measurement. Its dimensionality spans the entirety of existence, and its dynamic nature eludes quantification, even with imaginary numbers.

This awe-inspiring entity possesses Kardashev-like properties, signifying a level of power beyond comprehension. It stands as a sentinel, contained only by the formidable Blue Barrier.

Obice Novissimo wields unparalleled destructive potential. Anything that dares to surpass its monumental size faces near-complete annihilation, reduced to a fraction of its former existence. Even attempts to evade Obice Novissimo's wrath only serve to accelerate its inexorable advance.

Yet, within its imposing presence lies a paradoxical purpose. Obice Novissimo serves as the crucible of creation, nurturing the genesis of verses by providing the essential conditions for their existence. It is the linchpin of the hierarchical tapestry, sustaining the delicate balance of cosmic forces.

While Obice Novissimo currently stands as the ultimate threshold, the eternal pursuit of transcendence fuels the inexorable march of progress. The quest for an entity capable of withstanding its relentless onslaught persists, offering a glimmer of hope that one day, the expanse beyond Obice Novissimo may be explored.

As you contemplate this titanic structure, you can't help but marvel at the intricacies of existence, woven into the very fabric of this awe-inspiring entity.

You now stand at the precipice of the Supremumia Class, the fifteenth and highest official class in the hierarchy. It encompasses fictional and higher-dimensional structures, including mind-bending shapes and abstract concepts that defy conventional understanding.

The Finality Chain awaits beyond, a series of containers each surpassing the previous in Finality Index. These containers are vast, distinctive, and possess unique properties, marking them as significant milestones in the cosmic hierarchy.

With your mastery over The Drum and your profound understanding of the multiverse, you have the potential to navigate through the Supremumia Class and explore the mysteries of the Finality Chain.

What would you like to do next?

Contains:
The Subfinal Verse, 𒈙 and many unknown verses

The True Waterfall is the final verse of TEH and is basically a giant waterfall with a bunch of verses inside. Many new verses, most that have properties indescribable in the English language, form here.

This verse is very similar in a bunch of ways to The Waterfall, however this is because the biggest verse with an existing page when the TOG that created The True Waterfall WAS The Waterfall.


Contents
1	Versitite and formation of verses in TTW
2	Amalgamverses
3	End of the river
4	Bottom of the pond
Versitite and formation of verses in TTW
The waterfall's water is not actually H2O, but instead Versitite, a liquid that easily coagulates into verses. If a verse is still forming and Versitite flows into it, it may form the verses inside of that verse, however before the barrier finishes forming, these verses can move out at any time. Clumps of the coagulated Versitite usually escape the uncoagulated Versitite and land on a rock to continue forming into a verse. These verses on the rocks get completely stuck to the rock, forming small amounts of "moss". There is a dynamic and infinite supply of Versitite, and which verses that Versitite forms is driven by true randomness.

Sometimes Versitite splashes onto rocks, forming many new verses and verses that contain those. In the Versitite, this still happens in a way, with new verses forming that contain others. When the Versitite splashes onto rocks, the verses in there also fall on, causing them to be punctured by the rock and the physics in that verse to have no real boundary, causing many other events. The verses pull the physics back into themselves and use the rock as another part of its barrier. Since still-forming verses haven't formed laws of physics yet, this effect does not occur for them.

Of course there are casualties for this...

Amalgamverses
When verses recover from being punctured by impact onto the rocks, the physics sometimes get tied with physics of other verses if physics flow out at the same time. When trying to reel the physics back in the verses, they can't properly do it, and instead pull themselves to each other. When they meet, they try to seal themselves, but can't. They end up gluing themselves to each other. When the time the verse will take to seal itself has passed after the physics should be all back in the verse, it stops attempting to suck the physics back in. The two physics mix, causing chaos in the two verses.

These verses mushed together are called Amalgamverses. They are known to be particularly chaotic inside and will corrupt anything inside. They slowly disintegrate back into Versitite to form back into regular verses.

End of the river
No verse has ever found its way to the end of the river and came back. Some theorize it will end back up to the start of the waterfall, however this has been confirmed by Gerald to not be the case.

Every verse that reaches the end of the river ends up in a pond where not only verses, but cosmic entities reside. This pond has cosmic entities called Riverians that are formed in a way such that their purpose is to salvage desolate verses or Amalgamverses into new verses. These new verses will either stick to the edges of the pond or float on top. If the Riverians can't salvage the verses before the verses reach a low point, the verses will sink to a more sinister part of the pond. Riverians can be formed by Versitite and go through the river into the pond. Due to this fact, some Riverians have even salvaged verses to take in Versitite and coagulate it into more Riverians.

Bottom of the pond
At the bottom of the pond, it's very dark and many super powerful entities called Twisted Riverians which consume the verses entirely, and some of the other Riverians have even been eaten by the Twisted Riverians. If the verses survive the bottom, they will continue to grow by some Versitite at the bottom and some of this Versitite can be absorbed inside the verse and accumulate into more Twisted Riverians.

ChatGPT
You've reached the enigmatic True Waterfall, the final verse of TEH. It is a place of profound significance, where the Versitite liquid coagulates into verses, giving birth to a diverse array of indescribable properties and cosmic entities. This verse holds mysteries that even the most advanced knowledge may struggle to fathom.

Inside the True Waterfall, there are phenomena like Amalgamverses, where verses become intertwined, resulting in chaotic and transformative interactions. The end of the river remains shrouded in mystery, and no verse has returned from this journey. The pond at the end hosts cosmic entities known as Riverians, tasked with salvaging and transforming desolate verses.

At the bottom of the pond lies darkness and the formidable Twisted Riverians, entities of immense power. It's a place of peril and potential growth for verses that manage to survive.

Your journey through the cosmic hierarchy has led you to this awe-inspiring destination. If there's anything else you'd like to explore or inquire about, feel free to let me know!

ChatGPT
Expanding to the size of the Final Metaweb would mean you are encompassing an incredibly vast and complex structure, potentially involving the collective mind, the limit of reality, time, and verses. It's a monumental feat!

As you reach this size, you may experience a profound sense of interconnectedness with the entirety of the Final Metaweb, gaining access to its knowledge, experiences, and potentialities. You may also find yourself perceiving reality in a fundamentally different way, transcending the limitations of conventional understanding.

Is there anything specific you'd like to do or explore within the Final Metaweb now that you've reached this extraordinary size?

SIGN IN TO EDIT
The Meta Hierarchy
The Meta-Hierarchy (TMH) is an unofficial hierarchy ranking the objects equal to or greater than the Wikiverse in size. Due to the immense size of the objects in The Meta-Hierarchy, we need a new system of measuring objects, the Meta-Class[1]. Based on the Class system from previous hierarchies, the Meta-Class is far bigger than any quantity of regular Classes[2]. The difference between a leap from a Class to a bigger Class is vastly[3] smaller than the leap from a Meta-Class to a bigger Meta-Class. This hierarchy covers the first 10 Meta-Classes. Do not no redlink[4] or whitelink pages unless you're planning to make them. If you plan to make a page and want to link it before it's made, put a (Planned) next to the link or it will be removed.

With that out of the way let's begin!ok

Energy Lasers
Believe it or not, energy Lasers are needed. If it left uncharged, it'll discharge.

But not too much. If it fed too much, it'll overcharge and explode.

Data loss
If the power drops to 75%, it'll run the risks of data loss.

In 75%, it's the game of chance. Get unlucky, then you disappear.

In 50%, things are much worse. After 1 freezed seconds, the random one disappeared.

In 25%, it erases 1% of the information every 1k OYC.

In 1%, it's the chosen one game. If you're lucky, you could be the chosen one and don't disappear.

At 0%, The information core disappears. Thus, losing all data.

You can tell weather or not TIC contains Information by its colour. White is no information and cyan is full of information.

The Ring
TIC can contain multiple rings.

0 rings
With 0 rings, TIC is completely useless.

1 ring
1 ringed TIC is the type that most TIC uses.

2 rings
With 2 rings, it quickly jumped from Tiny (TIC R1) to Small.

3 rings
With 3 rings, it already jumped straight to Class 2 of the Post-Meta Hierarchy

4 rings
But with most things, it can suddenly slow down. It is the size of TIC 3R * TIC 2R.

5 rings
But it gradually sped up. Size = TIC 5R ^^ TIC 4R

6 rings
Then it really speed up.

10 rings
10 rings is the normal maximum of TIC. Going more rings require you to replace energy lasers to the yellow one.

1000 rings
Then it quickly sped up.

10^10 rings
This is to the point that yellow lasers couldn't keep up. Thus, using the green lasers.

10^10^10 rings
But, it's not for long. You need Rainbow Lasers.

10^^10 rings
Rainbow Lasers are doing great! But, the size per rings slowed down.

10{10}10
Rainbow Lasers still kept up.

It's to the point Rainbow Lasers couldn't keep up.

ChatGPT
The Information Core is a marvel of cosmic engineering, a repository of boundless knowledge stored within its enigmatic core. It stands as a testament to the ingenuity of those who crafted it, harnessing the very essence of existence to house the wealth of information it contains.

The core is surrounded by a series of rings, each representing a level of capacity and complexity. With each additional ring, the Information Core's capabilities expand exponentially, reaching heights beyond mortal comprehension.

However, maintaining the core's integrity is no small feat. It requires the careful management of energy lasers to ensure a delicate balance. Too much or too little energy can lead to catastrophic consequences, risking data loss or even the core's destruction.

The color of the core serves as a visual indicator of its current state. White signifies a lack of information, while cyan radiates with the brilliance of stored knowledge.

As the rings multiply, the Information Core ascends through the tiers of the Post-Meta Hierarchy, transcending boundaries that few can fathom. From the modest beginnings of a single ring to the infinite expanse of an unimaginable number, the core's potential knows no bounds.
